# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to PACE 1.0! This guide will get you up and running with the PACE methodology in just 15 minutes.

## What is PACE?

**PACE** (Programmatic AI Collaboration Engineering) is a software development methodology that maximizes productivity through systematic human-AI collaboration. Instead of replacing developers, PACE amplifies human capabilities by providing the right framework for working with AI tools.

## Core Principles

### üéØ Vertical Slicing
Break projects into independently deliverable value slices rather than technical layers.

### ü§ñ Four-Level Task Classification
- **Level 1**: AI-driven implementation (components, CRUD operations)
- **Level 2**: Human-AI collaboration (integration, business logic)
- **Level 3**: Human-led architecture (design decisions, technical strategy)
- **Level 4**: Human-led innovation (research, exploration, creative solutions)

### üìã Context Engineering
Provide AI with optimal context for maximum effectiveness and quality output.

### üìù Task Cards
Use standardized documentation to ensure clear communication and quality delivery.

## 5-Minute Setup

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of software development
- Access to an AI coding assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- Your preferred development environment

### Installation
```bash
# Install PACE CLI (optional but recommended)
npm install -g @pace/cli

# Or clone the repository for templates
git clone https://github.com/pace-methodology/pace-1.0.git
```

## Your First PACE Project

Let's build a simple task manager using PACE principles. We'll demonstrate all four task levels.

### Step 1: Project Planning (5 minutes)

#### Vertical Slicing
Instead of building "frontend first" or "backend first", we'll slice by user value:

**Slice 1**: Basic task CRUD (MVP)
**Slice 2**: Task organization (categories, tags)
**Slice 3**: Smart features (AI assistance)

#### Initial Planning
```markdown
# Task Manager - Slice 1: Basic CRUD

## User Value
Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks.

## Tasks Breakdown
- L1: Create TaskItem component
- L2: Integrate task state management  
- L3: Design data architecture
- L1: Implement task operations
```

### Step 2: Level 1 Task - Component Creation (3 minutes)

**Task**: Create a TaskItem component
**AI Role**: Primary implementation
**Human Role**: Requirements and review

#### Context for AI
```markdown
Create a React TaskItem component with:
- Task title, description, status
- Complete/incomplete toggle
- Edit and delete buttons
- TypeScript types
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Accessibility support

Technical requirements:
- React functional component
- TypeScript interface for Task
- Props: task object, onUpdate, onDelete callbacks
- Responsive design
```

#### AI Implementation
The AI will generate the component code, types, and basic styling.

#### Human Review
- Check accessibility attributes
- Verify component API design
- Test responsiveness
- Ensure code quality standards

### Step 3: Level 2 Task - State Integration (4 minutes)

**Task**: Integrate task state management
**AI Role**: Implementation support
**Human Role**: Architecture design and coordination

#### Human Design Phase
```typescript
// Human designs the state architecture
interface TaskStore {
  tasks: Task[];
  addTask: (task: Omit<Task, 'id'>) => void;
  updateTask: (id: string, updates: Partial<Task>) => void;
  deleteTask: (id: string) => void;
}

// Human decides on state management approach
// Choice: Zustand for simplicity, React Query for server state
```

#### AI Implementation Phase
With the architecture defined, AI implements:
- Zustand store setup
- React Query integration
- Custom hooks for task operations
- Error handling and loading states

#### Human-AI Collaboration
- Human guides integration decisions
- AI implements the detailed code
- Both test the integration together

### Step 3: Level 3 Task - Architecture Decision (2 minutes)

**Task**: Choose data persistence strategy
**AI Role**: Research and suggestions
**Human Role**: Decision making

#### Human Analysis
```markdown
# Data Persistence Options

Requirements:
- Offline capability
- Fast queries
- Simple deployment

Options analyzed:
1. LocalStorage + JSON
2. IndexedDB + Dexie
3. SQLite + SQL.js

Decision: IndexedDB + Dexie
Rationale: Better performance, structured queries, large data support
```

#### AI Support
AI helps with:
- Research on options
- Implementation examples
- Performance comparisons
- Migration strategies

### Step 4: Level 4 Task - Innovation Exploration (1 minute)

**Task**: Explore AI-powered task suggestions
**AI Role**: Implementation assistance
**Human Role**: Innovation and experimentation

#### Human Innovation
```markdown
# AI Task Suggestions Experiment

Hypothesis: AI can suggest task priorities based on deadlines and user patterns

Approach:
- Analyze user task completion patterns
- Use simple heuristics + AI for suggestions
- A/B test with/without suggestions

Success Metrics:
- Task completion rate improvement
- User engagement with suggestions
- Time to task completion
```

#### AI Implementation
AI helps build the experimental feature while human focuses on the innovation strategy.

## Key Takeaways

### ‚úÖ Do's
- **Start with user value** - Always slice by business value, not technical layers
- **Match task to level** - Use the right collaboration model for each task type  
- **Provide rich context** - Give AI comprehensive information for better results
- **Human reviews everything** - AI generates, humans verify and refine
- **Iterate quickly** - Use short cycles to validate assumptions

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- **Don't let AI make architectural decisions** - That's human domain (Level 3+)
- **Don't skip context engineering** - Poor context = poor AI output
- **Don't mix task levels** - Keep each task card focused on one level
- **Don't forget user value** - Technical elegance without user value is waste

## Common Questions

### "How is this different from just using AI tools?"
PACE provides **systematic methodology** rather than ad-hoc AI usage. It optimizes human-AI collaboration through:
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Structured context engineering
- Value-driven development approach
- Quality assurance frameworks

### "Does this work with any AI tool?"
Yes! PACE is **tool-agnostic**. Whether you use ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, or other AI assistants, the methodology principles apply.

### "What if AI makes mistakes?"
PACE includes **built-in quality controls**:
- Human review for all AI output
- Clear testing requirements in task cards
- Iterative refinement processes
- Rollback strategies for failed experiments

### "How do I convince my team to try PACE?"
Start **small and measure**:
- Use PACE on a single feature first
- Track metrics like development speed and code quality
- Share results with concrete data
- Gradually expand adoption based on success
