# Four-Level Task Classification System

## Overview

The Four-Level Task Classification System is the cornerstone of PACE 1.0's human-AI collaboration framework. By categorizing development tasks into four distinct levels, teams can optimize their collaboration approach, ensuring that human creativity and AI efficiency are applied where they're most effective.

## The Classification Framework

### Level Distribution in Typical Projects
```
Level 1 (Standardized Implementation): 40-50%
Level 2 (Integration Coordination): 25-35%  
Level 3 (Architectural Design): 15-25%
Level 4 (Innovation Exploration): 5-15%
```

### Collaboration Models by Level

└─ NO → Does this task require architectural decisions?
    ├─ YES → Level 3 (Architectural Design)
    └─ NO → Does this task require significant integration?
        ├─ YES → Level 2 (Integration Coordination)
        └─ NO → Level 1 (Standardized Implementation)
```

### Common Classification Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Over-Leveling Simple Tasks
```markdown
❌ Incorrect Classification:
Task: "Add a new field to user profile form"
Classified as: Level 3 (because it affects the user domain)

✅ Correct Classification:
Task: "Add a new field to user profile form"
Classified as: Level 1 (simple implementation following existing patterns)
```

#### Mistake 2: Under-Leveling Complex Tasks
```markdown
❌ Incorrect Classification:
Task: "Implement real-time collaboration features"
Classified as: Level 2 (integration task)

✅ Correct Classification:  
Task: "Implement real-time collaboration features"
Classified as: Level 3 (architectural decisions about WebSocket vs. WebRTC, 
conflict resolution strategies, data synchronization approaches)
```

#### Mistake 3: Mixing Task Levels
```markdown
❌ Mixed Level Task:
"Design and implement user authentication system"
- Contains both Level 3 (design decisions) and Level 1 (implementation)

✅ Separate Tasks:
Level 3: "Design user authentication architecture"
Level 1: "Implement login form component"
Level 1: "Implement authentication middleware"
Level 2: "Integrate authentication with user session management"
```
