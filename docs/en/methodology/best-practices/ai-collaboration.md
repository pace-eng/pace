# AI Collaboration Best Practices

## Overview

Effective AI collaboration is the heart of PACE 1.0 methodology. This guide provides proven strategies, patterns, and techniques for maximizing the productivity and quality of human-AI partnerships in software development.

## Foundational Principles

### Principle 1: Complementary Strengths
Leverage the unique strengths of both humans and AI rather than trying to replace one with the other.

**Human Strengths**:
- Creative problem-solving and innovation
- Domain expertise and business understanding
- Architectural thinking and system design
- Quality judgment and trade-off evaluation
- User empathy and experience design

**AI Strengths**:
- Rapid code generation and pattern implementation
- Comprehensive documentation and testing
- Consistent application of coding standards
- Pattern recognition and template application
- Detailed implementation of specifications

### Principle 2: Clear Responsibility Boundaries
Establish explicit boundaries for what humans vs. AI should handle in different scenarios.

```markdown
## Responsibility Matrix

| Task Type | Human Responsibility | AI Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Requirements | Define and validate | Ask clarifying questions |
| Architecture | Design and decide | Research and suggest options |
| Implementation | Review and guide | Generate and refine code |
| Testing | Design test strategy | Implement test code |
| Quality | Set standards and review | Apply standards consistently |
| Innovation | Creative exploration | Prototype and validate ideas |
```

### Principle 3: Iterative Refinement
Use iterative cycles to progressively improve both the output quality and the collaboration process itself.

```
Initial Context → AI Output → Human Review → Refined Context → Improved Output
```

## Context Engineering Mastery

### Strategy 1: Layered Context Provision

#### The Context Stack
```
┌─ Project Layer ────────────────────────┐
│ Business goals, tech stack, standards │
├─ Domain Layer ─────────────────────────┤
│ Feature area, business rules, data    │
├─ Task Layer ──────────────────────────┤
│ Specific requirements, constraints     │
└─ Session Layer ───────────────────────┘
  Current state, feedback, iteration
```

#### Example: Building Context for a Login Component
```markdown
# Project Layer (Establish once per session)
"We're building a React TypeScript SaaS application using:
- State management: Zustand
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Authentication: JWT tokens with refresh

Our coding standards emphasize:
- Functional components with custom hooks
- Comprehensive TypeScript typing
- Accessibility-first design (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile-first responsive approach"

# Domain Layer (For authentication features)
"Authentication domain details:
- Support email/password and OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- Auto-refresh token handling
- Login rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, number, special char
- Remember me functionality for 30 days"

# Task Layer (For this specific component)
"Create LoginForm component:
- Email and password input fields
- Show/hide password toggle
- Remember me checkbox
- Submit button with loading state
- Error display for validation and auth failures
- Link to forgot password page
- OAuth provider buttons

Must integrate with useAuth hook and follow our form patterns."

# Session Layer (Current iteration)
"Previous version had issue with password toggle not working on mobile Safari.
Error messages should appear below fields, not as overlay. Use our toast 
system for auth errors, not inline messages."
```

### Strategy 2: Example-Driven Context

#### Show, Don't Tell
Instead of describing patterns, provide concrete examples:

```typescript
// Context: "Follow our form patterns" → Not specific enough

// Better Context: "Follow this exact form pattern"
// Example from existing RegisterForm.tsx:

interface FormProps<T> {
  onSubmit: (data: T) => Promise<void>;
  schema: ZodSchema<T>;
  className?: string;
}

function FormWrapper<T>({ onSubmit, schema, className, children }: FormProps<T>) {
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors, isSubmitting } } = useForm<T>({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema)
  });
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className={className}>
      {children}
      <Button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
        {isSubmitting ? <Spinner /> : 'Submit'}
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
}

// Create LoginForm following this exact pattern
```

### Strategy 3: Constraint-Driven Context

#### Explicit Constraints and Rationale
```markdown
# Technical Constraints:
- Bundle size: Component must add <5KB to bundle (we have strict performance budgets)
- Browser support: Must work in Safari 14+ (our user base)
- Accessibility: Must be fully keyboard navigable and screen reader compatible
- Performance: Initial render must complete in <100ms

# Business Constraints:
- Security: No passwords in browser autocomplete cache
- Legal: GDPR compliance for EU users (explicit consent for remember me)
- UX: Maximum 3-step authentication flow
- Brand: Must use exact colors from design system tokens

# Team Constraints:
- Testing: 100% test coverage required for auth components
- Review: Security-critical code requires two approvers
- Documentation: Public APIs must have JSDoc comments
- Patterns: Must follow existing error handling conventions
```

## Communication Strategies

### Strategy 1: Progressive Disclosure
Start with high-level requirements and progressively add detail based on AI questions and output quality.

#### Round 1: High-Level Intent
```markdown
"Create a user dashboard component that shows key metrics and recent activity"
```

#### Round 2: Add Structure
```markdown
"The dashboard should have:
- Header with user name and notification badge
- 3-column metrics grid (tasks, projects, team members)
- Recent activity feed with timestamps
- Quick actions sidebar (create task, new project)"
```

#### Round 3: Add Details
```markdown
"For the metrics cards:
- Use Card component from our design system
- Show current value, percentage change, and trend indicator
- Clickable to navigate to detailed views
- Loading skeletons while data fetches

For the activity feed:
- Group by date with relative timestamps
- Show user avatars and action descriptions
- Infinite scroll for pagination
- Real-time updates via WebSocket"
```

### Strategy 2: Feedback-Driven Iteration

#### Structured Feedback Framework
```markdown
# Feedback Template

## What Works Well
- [Specific aspect that meets requirements]
- [Code quality or pattern that's correct]
- [Performance or accessibility win]

## What Needs Improvement  
- [Specific issue with clear description]
- [Expected behavior vs. actual behavior]
- [Reference to project patterns or constraints]

## Next Iteration Focus
- [Primary goal for next version]
- [Secondary improvements if time permits]
- [Context to add for better results]
```

#### Example Feedback Session
```markdown
"The LoginForm component you generated works well overall. Here's my feedback:

## What Works Well
- Form structure follows our FormWrapper pattern correctly
- TypeScript interfaces are comprehensive and accurate
- Accessibility attributes are properly implemented
- Error handling integrates with our validation system

## What Needs Improvement
- Password visibility toggle icon is incorrect (should use Eye/EyeOff from lucide-react)
- Submit button spacing doesn't match design system (should use space-y-4)
- Loading state needs skeleton loading for better UX
- Error messages should use our Toast component, not inline divs

## Next Iteration Focus
- Fix the visual inconsistencies with design system
- Improve loading state UX with proper skeletons
- Here's our Toast component usage pattern: [example code]"
```

### Strategy 3: Collaborative Problem-Solving

#### Joint Debugging Approach
When facing complex issues, work together rather than handing off:

```markdown
Human: "The form submission is failing intermittently. Let's debug this together."

AI: "I'll help analyze the issue. Can you share:
- Error messages from browser console
- Network requests in dev tools
- Steps to reproduce
- Current form submission code"
