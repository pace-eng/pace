# PACE 1.0 Methodology - English Documentation

## Welcome to PACE 1.0

**PACE** stands for **Programmatic AI Collaboration Engineering** - a revolutionary software development methodology designed for the AI era. PACE 1.0 provides a systematic approach to human-AI collaboration in software development, optimizing productivity while maintaining quality and innovation.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

PACE 1.0 is built on the principle that **the future of software development lies in effective human-AI collaboration**, not in replacement of human developers. Our methodology provides the framework to harness AI's strengths while leveraging human creativity, judgment, and domain expertise.
